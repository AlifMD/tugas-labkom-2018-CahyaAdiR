	<h1>Definition And Functional Group Of Acetone</h1>
		
		<h2>What is the Definiton of Acetone?</h2>
	
			<p>Acetone is a colorless, flammable liquid that evaporates easily. It is an organic compound because carbon atoms are present in acetone's chemical formula, which is (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO. It consists of three carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.Acetonecan also be called to as propanone, dimethyl keton, 2-propanone, propan-2-one, dimethylformaldehyde, dan β-ketopropana,.</p>
		
	
		<h2>How About the Functional Group of Acetone?</h2>

			<p>The functional group of Acetone is Ketones, Acetone is organic compounds containing a carbonyl group bonded to two hydrocarbon groups. Acetone has a carbonyl group, where carbon and oxygen are bonded to each other with a double bond and is known as the simplest ketone. Acetone, an organic compound, is chemically described as CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>. Acetone is a hydrocarbon derivative, more specifically a ketone in it’s simplest form. A ketone has a carbon double bonded to an oxygen and a bond with two other separate carbon atoms. Although similar, ketones are separate from aldehydes as aldehyde's carbonyl group is located at the end of the carbon chain, meaning that a carbon is double bonded to an oxygen, bonded to another carbon, and bonded to a hydrogen atom.</p>

			<p>Acetone's functional group, being the carbonyl group, is polar. This is because the electronegativity of the oxygen is greater than that of the carbon, creating a polar bond. The carbonyl group interacts with water, allowing it to be able to participate in hydrogen bonding. Although ketone's cannot hydrogen bond with themselves, they can with water molecules. This, as well as their polarity, gives them the property of being able to disassociate in water. Acetone's melting and boiling points are much lower than that of waters, because acetone does not have as strong of intermolecular forces as water. Because of the weaker forces of attraction between acetone molecules. </p>

			<h2>How Preparation Of Acetone ?</h2>
			<p>Oxidation of secondary alcohols
				The oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones may be carried out using strong oxidizing agents, because further oxidation of a ketone occurs with great difficulty. Normal oxidizing agents include potassium dichromate (K 2Cr 2O 7) and chromic acid (H 2CrO 4). The conversion of 2‐propanol to 2‐propanone illustrates the oxidation of a secondary alcohol. </p>

				<p>Hydration of alkynes
					The addition of water to an alkyne leads to the formation of an unstable vinyl alcohol. These unstable materials undergo keto‐enol tautomerization to form ketones. The hydration of propyne forms 2‐propanone, as the following figure illustrates</p>

				<p>Ozonolysis of alkenes
					When one or both alkene carbons contain two alkyl groups, ozonolysis generates one or two ketones. The ozonolysis of 1,2‐dimethyl propene produces both 2‐propanone (a ketone) and ethanal (an aldehyde).</p>

					<p>Grignard reagents
						Hydrolysis of the salt formed by reacting a Grignard reagent with a nitrile produces good ketone yields. For example, you can prepare acetone by reacting the Grignard reagent methyl magnesium bromide (CH 3MgBr) with methyl nitrile (CH 3CbondN).  </p>
