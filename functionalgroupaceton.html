	<h1>Functional Group Of Acetone</h1>
	<p>Acetone is a colorless, flammable liquid that evaporates easily. It is an organic compound because carbon atoms are present in acetone's chemical formula, which is (CH3)2O. It consists of three carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.
		
	The functional group of Acetone is Ketones, Acetone is organic compounds containing a carbonyl group bonded to two hydrocarbon groups. Acetone has a carbonyl group, where carbon and oxygen are bonded to each other with a double bond and is known as the simplest ketone.
	Acetone, an organic compound, is chemically described as CH3COCH3, and can also be called to as 2-propanone. Acetone is a hydrocarbon derivative, more specifically a ketone in itâ€™s simplest form. A ketone has a carbon double bonded to an oxygen and a bond with two other separate carbon atoms. Although similar, ketones are separate from aldehydes as aldehyde's carbonyl group is located at the end of the carbon chain, meaning that a carbon is double bonded to an oxygen, bonded to another carbon, and bonded to a hydrogen atom.
	</p>
	<p>Acetone's functional group, being the carbonyl group, is polar. This is because the electronegativity of the oxygen is greater than that of the carbon, creating a polar bond. The carbonyl group interacts with water, allowing it to be able to participate in hydrogen bonding. Although ketone's cannot hydrogen bond with themselves, they can with water molecules. This, as well as their polarity, gives them the property of being able to disassociate in water. 
	Acetone's melting and boiling points are much lower than that of waters, because acetone does not have as strong of intermolecular forces as water. Because of the weaker forces of attraction between acetone molecules. </p>
