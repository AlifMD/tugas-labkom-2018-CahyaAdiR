	<h1>Functional Group Of Acetone</h1>
	<p>Acetone is organic compound. Acetone have another name there is 2-propanone.the functional group of acetone is ketone.A ketone has a carbon double bonded to an oxygen and a bond with two other separate carbon atoms.Acetone's functional group is the carbonyl group.
	Acetone's functional group, being the carbonyl group, is polar. This is because the electronegativity of the oxygen is greater than that of the carbon, creating a polar bond.
	Acetone's melting and boiling points are much lower than that of waters, because acetone does not have as strong of intermolecular forces as water does. </p>
